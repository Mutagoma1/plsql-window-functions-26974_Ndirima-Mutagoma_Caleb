Business Context
IKAWA Retail Corporation, a multi-region retail company operating in the consumer goods industry, needs to enhance its sales analytics capabilities to support data-driven decision making across marketing, inventory management, and regional operations.

Data Challenge
The company lacks comprehensive analytical insights into customer purchasing patterns, product performance across regions, and sales trends over time. Current reporting provides basic aggregates but fails to deliver the nuanced insights needed for strategic planning and operational optimization.

Expected Outcome
Implement advanced window functions to identify top-performing products by region, analyze sales trends, segment customers by value, and provide actionable insights for inventory planning and targeted marketing campaigns.

Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter → Implement using RANK() and partitioning

Running Monthly Sales Totals → Calculate using SUM() OVER() with ordered frames

Month-over-Month Growth Analysis → Compute using LAG() for period comparisons

Customer Value Segmentation → Segment using NTILE(4) for quartile analysis

3-Month Moving Averages → Implement using AVG() OVER() with sliding windows
